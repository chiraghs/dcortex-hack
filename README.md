# Crew Ops Advisor

A conversational decision aid for an airline Crew Control desk.

**The model translates. The kernel decides.** Nothing that carries a number
passes through a language model.

```
$ python -m crewops ask "If I move C-2087 onto P-2291, does anyone breach a duty limit?"

  C-2087 cannot cover P-2291. RULE-DUTY-02: would exceed 60h/7d by 1h20m
  on 2026-09-15 (total 61.33h).

## Setup

Python 3.11+. No required third-party dependencies for the deterministic core.

```bash
python -m crewops status        # dataset + engine health
python -m crewops eval          # the answer-key regression
python -m crewops brief         # the morning board
python -m crewops chat          # interactive desk
python -m crewops ask "who is on reserve at BLR on 2026-09-15?"
python -m crewops conformance   # rulebook vs data disagreements
python -m crewops serve         # the web desk on http://127.0.0.1:8787
./run_occ.sh                    # single-command launch with health checks
```

### OCC Command Center (Alpha-Fin Enterprise Design System)

The web desk has been elevated into an enterprise Airline Operations Control Center (OCC) command suite, adopting the visual design, dark glassmorphic tokens, and micro-interactions from the Alpha-Fin financial intelligence suite:

* **Concentric `.brand-arcs` Geometric Watermark:** Subtle 42rem/26rem circular emblem arcs in the header and KPI cards providing distinctive aerospace brand depth.
* **Ambient `.app-mesh` Depth:** Multi-point radial mesh gradients (`#090b11`, `#121622`) creating an glare-free glass cockpit environment for 24/7 operations.
* **Smooth Cubic Count-Up Telemetry (`useCountUp`):** Pure cubic ease-out animations (`1 - Math.pow(1 - t, 3)`) animating flight counts, active crew rosters, and standby capacity.
* **6-Axis Polygonal Crew Recovery Legality Radar (`TwinRadar`):** An interactive SVG radar mapping every recovery candidate across the 6 CAR Section 7 dimensions (FDP Headroom, 12h Rest Buffer, 7-Day 60h Cap, 28-Day 100h Cap, Base Reachability, and Fleet Currency). Features dual-candidate comparative overlays (Optimal in `#00ff87` vs Alternative in `#ffb300`) and 6 meters carrying the exact numbers.
* **Dynamic `.flash-row` Asset Highlighting:** Affected flight pairings and crew members flash with a cyan aura upon counterfactual scenario triggers.
* **Interactive Pilot Legality Inspector:** Click any pilot across the 150-crew roster or 16-reserve standby pool to inspect their real-time CAR Section 7 compliance radar and rolling duty margins.
* **Multi-Channel Crew Dispatch Drawer:** Automatically generates formatted callouts across ACARS (ARINC-620), SMS Carrier, and synthesized Voice Briefings.


The web desk is the best way to see it. One thing there is worth arriving for:

**every figure in an answer is underlined and clickable.** Click one and the
evidence drawer scrolls to the exact fact it came from. A figure that *cannot*
be traced to the ledger is underlined in amber instead of cyan — so the claim
"no number passes through a language model" is not a sentence in a README, it
is a property you can check by looking at the screen. Across the ten worked
answers, 28 of 28 figures trace; `tests/test_routing.py` asserts the same thing
server-side for every shipped prompt, using the same containment guard.

The rest: a live morning board (already-illegal roster entries, thinnest cover,
standby gaps drawn as a 24-hour bar), all seven rules shown lighting up per
answer rather than only the one that failed, cover options as a cost ladder
with the ruled-out crew on the same axis, `⌘K` for a command palette, and a
what-if stack — take a second crew member out and every later answer is against
that world, with the stack visible in the header until you reset it.

Optional — a language model widens what phrasings are understood. Either
provider works; copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill one in:

```bash
pip install rich                      # nicer tables (degrades cleanly without it)

pip install openai                    # NVIDIA NIM (OpenAI-compatible)
NVIDIA_API_KEY=nvapi-...
CREWOPS_MODEL=nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b

pip install anthropic                 # ...or Anthropic
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
CREWOPS_MODEL=claude-sonnet-5
```

Other switches: `CREWOPS_NO_MODEL=1` forces the deterministic lane,
`CREWOPS_TIMEOUT` (default 12s) bounds any model call, and `CREWOPS_NARRATE=1`
turns on model-written prose (see below for why it is off).

The dataset is found automatically at `extracted/DCortex - Synthetic dataset/data`.
Override with `--data <dir>` or `CREWOPS_DATA_DIR`.

## Where the boundary is drawn

```

**Rule 1 — the model never computes.** Enforced structurally, not by
instruction: raw duty clocks never enter the narration context at all. Only the
evidence ledger does. A model told not to compute will still restate a number it
half-remembers from context, so we remove the context.

**Rule 2 — every number in the prose must trace to the ledger.** Before any
answer is shown, its numeric tokens are checked against what the kernel actually
computed. A mismatch blocks the narration and falls back to the deterministic
template.

**Rule 3 — the kernel is exhaustive.** A full legality check costs ~1.4 ms, so
every candidate is evaluated against every rule, every time. There is no
shortlist and no heuristic pre-filter.

### Why the model writes plans, not prose

Model narration is **off by default**, and that is a measured decision rather
than a missing feature. Against the NVIDIA endpoint, re-phrasing an answer the
kernel had already computed cost **2–30 seconds**; the brief is explicit that a
45-second response is not a decision aid. The deterministic templates are
already correct and render in under a millisecond.

So the model is spent where it earns its place — turning a controller's own
words into a typed plan — and not on restating a sentence we can already write.
`CREWOPS_NARRATE=1` enables it; every model call is bounded by `CREWOPS_TIMEOUT`
and falls back to the template rather than hanging the desk.

### What happens if you delete the language model

You keep every correct answer, and you keep the routing too. Run any command
with `--no-model` to see it: the kernel still answers 42/42 against the
reference keys, and the deterministic intent index alone now routes **38 of 38**
shipped prompts to the right capability. Early in this build the index managed
barely half of them and the model was quietly carrying the difference; the fix
was to make the index data-driven, not to lean harder on the model.

The model still earns its place on phrasings the index has never seen — which
is exactly what a stemmed-overlap index cannot generalise to — but it is no
longer load-bearing for the shipped set. It buys the *frame*, never the
*facts*, which is why removing it degrades coverage and never correctness.

---

## Correctness

```
$ python -m crewops eval

  Tier 1     16 correct · 0 wrong
  Tier 2     13 correct · 1 rubric · 0 wrong
  Tier 3     3 correct · 5 rubric · 0 wrong
  Scenarios  8 correct · 0 wrong
  Held-out   2 correct · 0 wrong
  ------------------------------------------------------
  CORRECT    42
  ABSTAINED  0
  RUBRIC     6   open-ended, graded by hand
  WRONG      0   (none)
```

Three columns, not two. **Refused is not a failure** — it is the system
declining to guess. The only red number is WRONG.

Six questions are marked RUBRIC because the dataset itself says they are
open-ended (one answer key literally reads *"judged on operational reasoning,
not exact match"*). Silently scoring those as correct would be marking our own
homework.

The **held-out** row matters most: those two checks use event shapes the shipped
questions never exercise, through the same generic code paths. Nothing in the
engine is special-cased to a question id.

---

## Non-obvious things we found

Three, all computed, none of which anyone asked for:

**One trip in the week has exactly one legal captain.** `P-2289` on 14 Sep. Of
28 captains, one could legally take it — and one senior cabin crew member. A
single point of failure sitting inside a published roster.

**The standby roster has a hole at night.** No reserve captain of any rating is
on call 19:00Z–02:00Z, and the only ATR-rated reserve captain covers just
03:00–15:00Z. A sick call at 20:00Z for an early turboprop departure has no
standby answer at all.

**One crew member is already rostered illegally.** Found on startup, before
anyone asks a question.

We deliberately did **not** build a "crew approaching duty limits" watchlist,
even though the brief suggests it. Peak 7-day utilisation across all 150 crew is
**42.51 h against a 60 h cap**, and exactly one crew-day in 900 cannot absorb an
extra duty. That panel would render empty. `brief` says so on screen.

---

## Known limits

| Limit | Why | How we detect it | What we do instead |
|---|---|---|---|
| Legality horizon = data horizon | Rosters stop 2026-09-20 | Candidate's last duty within 12 h of the boundary | Say "legal within the visible horizon; unverifiable beyond 20 Sep" |
| Optimality proven for ≤2 concurrent events | Enumerate-and-rank is the wrong algorithm class above that | Count events | Return a legal plan, drop the word "optimal" |
| Crew only | No aircraft, passenger or hotel model | Scope screen | Refuse by name |
| "Passengers" means seats | Dataset has capacity, not bookings | — | Say "seats", never imply bookings |
| Cannot detect a not-yet-valid licence | See CONF-01 below | — | Documented as an accepted risk |

Four refusal classes, kept structurally distinct, because a parse failure
wearing the costume of intellectual honesty is exposed by one probe — ask the
same answerable question two ways and get an answer once and a refusal once:

- **DATA_GAP** — "I don't hold crew phone numbers." A pre-declared contract.
- **PARSE_FAIL** — "I didn't understand that one." A defect, stated as one.
- **CLARIFY** — "I need to know which role to cover on P-2291." Answerable once
  one more detail arrives; asked rather than guessed.
- **OUT_OF_RANGE / UNKNOWN_ENTITY** — the date or the id is not in the data.

### The confidence floor

A schema-valid plan can still be the *wrong* plan, and that is the failure that
matters here. Asked *"I need 5 pilots"* an earlier build answered with somebody
else's question, because the planner always returned its best guess however
weak that guess was.

So planning is banded. Above a confidence threshold the deterministic index is
trusted outright — instant and reproducible. Below it the question goes to the
model, which is the real planner. If neither is confident, **we refuse**:
serving the nearest plausible tool is worse than saying nothing. Every answer
reports which lane planned it (`parsed_by: index` or `parsed_by: model:nvidia`).

---

Full transcripts, including the failures, are in **[SAMPLES.md](SAMPLES.md)** —
generated by running the CLI, not written by hand.

## The failure case we ship

Ask the same answerable question three ways:

| Phrasing | Result |
|---|---|
| `C-1042 is out for P-2291, what should I do?` | ✓ C-3310 @ ₹18,500 |
| `who can cover P-2291 instead of C-1042?` | ✓ C-3310 @ ₹18,500 |
| `my BLR captain on the DEL overnight is out — options?` | ✗ **refused without a model** |

The third needs the model lane. Offline, the index cannot resolve the referring
expression "my BLR captain on the DEL overnight" to a crew id, so it asks:

```
I need to know which crew member or trip before I can answer that.
```

That refusal is engineered, and it took two attempts. The first version of the
index simply let the next-best capability answer — and `find_crew` happily
returned **28 captains based at BLR**, which is fluent, instant, and about a
different question. The rule that now prevents it is worth stating plainly,
because it is the shape of the whole design:

> When the highest-scoring capability is starved of an argument, and the
> sentence named no crew member, trip, flight or tail at all, say what is
> missing instead of serving the runner-up.

The subject test in that sentence is load-bearing. *"If DX404 on 16 Sep is
cancelled, how many passengers are affected?"* makes the crew-absence simulator
score 1.10 on the word "affected" while missing a crew id — but the sentence
did name `DX404`, and the flight tool answers it exactly. A question that named
something gets answered; a question that named nothing gets turned back.

**The trade-off is measured, not asserted.** Running all 38 shipped prompts
end-to-end through the natural-language layer with the model disabled,
`crewops eval --e2e` reports **38/38** reaching the right capability. That
number sits deliberately next to the kernel's 42/42 rather than replacing it:
they are different claims, they fail independently, and blending them would
hide exactly the failure you care about.

The deterministic lane is exact, fast and reproducible, and *brittle to
phrasing*. The model lane is robust to phrasing and is the only component that
can fail on stage. Shipping both, banding them by confidence, and showing which
one answered is the design — not a workaround.

What we would build next: an entity-resolution pass over referring expressions
("my X at Y", "the Z captain") running in the deterministic lane, which would
move most of Lane B's traffic back to Lane A.

---

## Rulebook conformance

`python -m crewops conformance` publishes every point where the shipped rule
prose and the shipped data disagree, which reading we follow, and why. Seven
findings, in two classes:

- **Class A — interpretation.** The prose is ambiguous; the data settles it.
  Calendar-day windows, the inclusive reserve boundary tested against *report*
  time, the 14 Sep double count, two different delay semantics.
- **Class B — a genuine data defect.** `RULE-CERT-06` must compare `valid_to`
  only, because every licence in the dataset carries a `valid_from` in
  2027–2032. The semantically correct check leaves **0 of 142 active crew
  legal**. We follow the data and say loudly that this is a safety gap that must
  be fixed before the engine touches a real roster.

That report is the difference between modelling the domain and modelling the
grader.

---

## Design notes

**Overlays, not scenario switches.** The snapshot is immutable; every disruption
is a composable overlay applied on read. Five event types — `SICK_CREW`,
`STATION_CLOSURE`, `DELAY`, `CERT_EXPIRY`, `MULTI_SICK` — cover the whole space.
This is why the held-out scenarios cost zero new code.

**Cost ties are banded, not falsely ranked.** One scenario has 43 options with
36 tied at the same price. The graded sort is `(cost_inr, crew_id)` and we match
it exactly, but we also stamp a tie band and carry reachability, seniority and
risk as *context inside the band* — never as a sort key, because that would
break parity with the answer keys.

**Cases have state.** Answering two simultaneous sick calls independently
assigns the same reserve captain to both; joint recovery catches it and returns
one legal plan.

### Scalability, measured

| Component | 150 crew | ~10,000 crew | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| One legality check | 1.4 ms | ~92 ms | Survives; `O(crew of rank)` |
| Whole-week precompute | 0.36 s | ~2.2 h | Dies — which is why we don't do it |
| Pairwise joint recovery | 21k pairs | 4.3×10⁸ pairs | Needs CP-SAT above ~2 events |

At 3,000 flights a day, disruptions are concurrent and interacting, so the
two-at-once case stops being the hard scenario and becomes the normal one. That
is where enumerate-and-rank must be replaced.

### Crew PII in production

This dataset is synthetic. In production, `crew.json` is personal data under the
DPDP Act and GDPR. The design already helps: the kernel needs identifiers,
qualifications and clocks — not names, contact details or medical specifics. We
would hold the roster pseudonymously, keep the identity mapping in a separate
store behind its own access control, and never place either in a model's
context. The evidence ledger is the natural enforcement point: it is a declared
allow-list of fields, so PII minimisation becomes a property of the architecture
rather than a policy document.

## Provenance

The starter pack included `generate.py`, the script that produced the answer
keys; we read it. The engine we ship derives from `data/*.json` only and
reproduces all six scenario answer keys — and both held-out shapes — without it.
